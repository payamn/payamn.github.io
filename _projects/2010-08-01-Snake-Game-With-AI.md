It was a 2D game which made by using C language, and I called it snake game. In my game players can eat letters and get special abilities. for example, if someone eats "PAC", he can eat other snake and gain points and length, or if he eats "BOMB", he can make a bomb. Each snake can eat heart to gain point and increase its length. My game can be played by three mods one player, two player and against AI. My project ranked <b>first</b> for it's AI (artificial inteligence)  in Advanced programming class.
