Designed a 2D snake game which using C language. Snake can eat letters to get special abilities. for example, if a snake eats "PAC",it can eat other snake and gain points and length, or if it eats "BOMB", it can make a bomb. Each snake can eat heart to gain point and increase its length. The game can be played in three settings: one player, two player and against AI. My project ranked <b>first</b> for it's AI (artificial inteligence)  in Advanced programming class.
