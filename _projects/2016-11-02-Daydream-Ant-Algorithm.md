In this study, we present a new way to solve the classic task of collecting resources from some food sources to home by autonomous robots. Robots will use the ant-algorithm to find their way from the source and then deliver food back to their home. The most important features that we added is to give our robots the ability to plan ahead and even plan during the time that they are using the ant algorithm.  We observed that when we are using the ant-algorithm in real robots, we are wasting a lot of time and resources to converge to a good path. So we present an approach to do all the thinking in simulation robots and deliver the best path to the real robots.
