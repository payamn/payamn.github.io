short: Built a snake robot using servo motor and ATMEGA32
---

I made this robot in high school. We used servo motors, an infrared light sensor (for detecting obstacle), a wireless camera (To send back the robot vision) and an ATMEGA32 (It was the center processor of this robot, and it had to control servo motors using infrared light sensor).
