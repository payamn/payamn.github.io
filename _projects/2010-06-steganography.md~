It’s a text based menu-driven application written in C and it can hide a text file in a Bitmap image and extract it back from the image. After researching and reading some papers and articles, our group planned to implement a method called “[Adaptive Data Hiding in Edge Areas of Images With Spatial LSB Domain Systems](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2008.926097)”. Our program can hide up to 15 bits in each pixel of the image. I personally really enjoyed writing this project and I learned a lot during working on it. This was the project of my second programming course at the University and was marked as the best project both by the instructor and the students.
