short: Use a combination of Deep RL and transfer learning to train an agent to do maximal map coverage in an unknown map.

---
Built a hybrid network trained by a supervised algorithm to learn preliminary tasks, like obstacle avoidance, and then used Deep Reinforcement Learning to learn maximal map exploration. This work presented as a poster in IROS 2017. Tools: Tensorflow, Keras, ROS, Stage, Python, C++, OpenCV
