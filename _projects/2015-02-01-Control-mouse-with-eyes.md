I used eye tracking to control mouse using OpenCV. First of all, I searched to find How we can  track human eyes. so I found a paper about it(click  [*here*](http://www.inb.uni-luebeck.de/publikationen/pdfs/TiBa11b.pdf) to see the paper). Then I tried to find the eye pupil position when a person looks to 4 corners of screen, and I used these points to understand where he is looking and move the mouse to that position.
