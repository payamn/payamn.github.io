It was a project for Graphic course. It is a two Player first person shoote gamer; First player can create a game on his computer, and second player can join the game on second computer over network. In this project, I became familiar with basic of networking and 3D object techniques since I made this project from beginning to end; moreover, I learned how to use animation by using skeleton in DirectX. In this game player can shoot to object or other players, and they will be destroyed after their health was finished. The game starts in Harry Potter quidditch field.
