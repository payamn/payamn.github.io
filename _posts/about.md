## Hello World!

My name is Payam.
I am currently a graduate student at [*Simon Fraser University*](https://www.sfu.ca/) under the supervision of Prof. Richard Vaughan. My thesis is about a robot that follows ahead of its leader.  I received my B.Sc. in Software Engineering at the Department of CSE and IT of [*Shiraz University*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz_University),


You can access my résumé from the sidebar.

Thanks for stopping by!
